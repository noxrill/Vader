    This meant red light graphics front and rear, red accents, red paint and even red interiors, as far as we can make them out to be. As expected, it’s the Bolide that looks almost like something out of the Stars Wars universe. However, that’s mostly because of its original styling, and not the red and black theme. The most evil-looking “gaze” clearly belongs to the Centodieci, which Bugatti built as an homage to the iconic EB110.

    Its 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged W16 engine produces a staggering 1,578 hp (1,600 ps) and its production has been capped at 10 units, each priced at just under $9 million.
